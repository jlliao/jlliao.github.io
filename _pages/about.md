I am a Computer Science student at Yale-NUS College. My focus is in technology solution architecture and business restructuring, for which I shape and drive end-to-end digital transformations across business, technology, process and people. I have interned first at Microsoft, then SAP, SkyLab, and Mckinsey.

In my spare time, I play the piano and write books of travels. Here are some of my works: [2010 *Days in Canada*; 2015 *Live Awake*](https://jlliao.dudaone.com/book).
