Experts claim that the so-called “Big Data” will revolutionize our health industries and healthcare systems. But data have always been essential since the birth of healthcare.

“Healthcare must be recognized as a right, not a privilege.” When Bernie Sanders put this statement as the campaign slogan for his Medicare plan, many people, even though some might disagree with his plan, undeniably resonate with this statement. Health is so fundamental to our lives that everyone should have the right to live regardless of one’s income.

However, when we bring data into healthcare, more and more often we see data as an elusive concept that only applies to cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence or machine learning. Yet that is only one small part of the whole picture. Data, whether collected or analyzed, have always played an important part in healthcare. Data allows us to make informed decisions, and these decisions, even seemly negligible ones, would save millions of lives and improve their health with minimum costs.

# Every Bit Is A Life

Today when we talk about “Big Data”, we often consider information we obtain over the Internet and how large the size of data we are generating every day. From Facebook to Amazon, from YouTube to Google, we have data that cover all aspects of our activities and identities. Most of the time, people ask: how can we organize, process and analyze these data more efficiently and effectively?

Yet in the field of healthcare, to make changes to people’s lives, especially in developing and under-developed countries, the biggest question is not how we can process these data. Compared to other fields of business and industries, the healthcare industry is still far behind in the first stage of our Big Data envision – the data collection. When I was working at World Health Organization in Swaziland in 2014, Ministry of Health was not able to provide an accurate assessment of infant and maternal mortality until the new policy on the collection of vital demographic statistics was implemented with the help of our task team.

On the national level, in many parts of the world, we do not know how many infants have died annually, or what are the main causes of their death. From a more personal angle, we do not understand the needs of the elderly, or the mentally ill. In other words, most of the time in healthcare, it is not that the overflowing data are waited to be processed; rather, it is the deficiency of data that stops doctors, professionals, and policymakers from making informed, effective decisions. We understand that there are children who die of diseases that could be prevented by a one-dollar vaccine. We also know if some patients are checked by an experienced radiologist annually, early signs of cancers might be found, and the disease would not progress. However, due to the lack of information, many of these preventable tragedies are still happening all the time.

# Why and How: Getting Health Data

Before the arrival of computers, paper forms have been the only way to collect data on people’s health, drug supply, blood supply, etc. Therefore, the reaction time for the public health system before was lengthy. Considering the fact that a national census usually takes more than one year to conduct, death or deterioration of health often happens in light speed even before all data are properly collected. Let alone that many of these data are of low quality and incomplete to facilitate effective treatments, medical research, and policymaking. In the event of an epidemic outbreak, without clinics and hospitals that can react in military speed, the impact of such would be wide-spread and long-lasting. Luckily, with the arrivals of computers and Internet, health data can be collected more efficiently and organized more effectively.

However, if computers are only used as a replacement for paper forms, they would not be a revolutionary approach to collecting health data. The core of such data collection process is still a top-down approach, as the health professionals carry a laptop or iPad and approach individuals to hopefully collect their relevant health data. Except for the fact that all records are digitalized, which allows storing and processing, nothing has changed much in terms of the procedure.

Yet, what truly revolutionizes healthcare is the development of smartphones, for which miniaturized computers can be brought alone anytime, anywhere. As the penetration rate of smartphones starts to approach half of the population in South East Asia, the top-down approach seems to be less and less essential. Why would you need people going to individuals if they can simply provide data themselves? People just need to hear about it and go to the website or application you provided. They can fill up the forms themselves that would provide valuable information about their health. Cloud-based, no training, no fieldworks. All look more efficient and effective with the bottom-up approach. The real question is: will people actively and willingly provide their health data?

# Creating a Nudge: Keep Fit All the Time

Traditionally, people would willingly give their health data to one authority, the hospital. But for predictive resource planning, medical research, nutrition consulting, these data are far from enough. We need to know the eating habit of the patients, the sleeping cycle, the activity level, so on and so forth. How do we motivate people to provide their health data?

The answer is: we need not do so. People are more than willing to share their health data if they have the demand. Workout app can provide information on activity levels. SmartWatch can collect information on heart rates lively and silently (I have written another review article on wearables: [Less is More, Especially for Wearables](https://jlliao.com/2018/03/09/less-is-more-especially-for-wearables/)). There is a great deal of focus on pooling data from various mobile devices in order to aggregate and make sense of more live health data. Apple’s ResearchKit is aiming to do this in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and Asperger’s syndrome by allowing users to access interactive apps (one of which applies machine learning for facial recognition) that assess their conditions over time; their use of the app feeds ongoing progress data into an anonymous pool for future study. IBM is going to great lengths to acquire all the health data it can get its hands on, from partnering with Medtronic to make sense of diabetes and insulin data in real time, to buying out healthcare analytics company Truven Health for $2.6B.

What we need to do is to create a nudge, where people provide health data willingly and understand the benefits without tireless explanations. [Healint](https://www.healint.com/), the company I am interning as a developer, created a mobile application Migraine Buddy that guides migraine patients to record their symptoms in real time. The motivation behind the behavior is two-folded: either the doctor asks patients to record migraines using the app, so he can get more insights from the records, or the patients would like to understand more about their own chronic diseases through machine learning and data analytics embedded in the application.

But the positive side effect is unlimited: pharmaceutical companies can gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of their medications; drug companies can also work on drug discovery with the help of machine learning. Applications might aid in helping physicians make the right considerations in diagnosis and treatment, simply by serving as an extension of scientific knowledge.

In the end, instead of having a program in which we’re scaling at such a slow rate that we can never reach all the people who need us, we’ve made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us. We’ve created a tool that lets programs track the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that die, make insights from health data to improve medical treatment and drug discovery – to do all these different things to learn more about what’s going on, to understand more, and to save lives and improve lives.
