After spending much of my time coding, speaking and leaning constantly every day, my eyes have become sore and my mind has become numbed.  I realised that if I do not break away from this pattern of working for a little while, I would not be able to throw off this feeling of inertia. Therefore, I decided that just before I go to bed for a good sleep every night, I would ask myself some big questions to get me used to thinking freely and actively. Some questions often cross my mind but I have yet to grip the answer of: What is my value? How to solve a problem? How would technology evolve in the future? What is leadership? I realised that I would not be able to come up with answers if I just sat and meditated using simple induction, so below are the four books I have selected to guide me in contemplating these big questions. If you also have some thoughts on your mind, this selection is definitely worth a try. Although they may not explicitly provide you with any answers, they will surely give you some inspiration in framing your thoughts.

# Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy by Simon Blackburn

I love philosophy because it inspires and helps me in practicing the underpinning power of all problem solving – reasoning. Think is an excellent book that will get you started on the quest of answering big questions, just as what is laid out by Prof. Blackburn in his introduction:

> Who am I? What is the world? Does god exist? Do I have a free will? These are questions every single one of us has asked himself in the course of his life: some only to consider them as unimportant and forget about them, others countless times, dwelling on possible answers and becoming more and more fascinated with them. If you are one of the latter – and I certainly am – this is a book for you.

Blackburn gives a basic overview of the central arguments in each popular field of philosophy: knowledge, mind, free will, self, god, reasoning and the world. While evaluating these arguments, Blackburn conveys his fascination for philosophy to the reader. However, you cannot read this book passively and consume its contents like a work of light fiction. This is not an easy read (quite natural, because the subject matter is not easy); you really have to think while enjoying the fruits of famous classical philosophers. But the book is worth the effort for anyone with budding interest in philosophy. Blackburn groups philosophical arguments into different categories of reasoning, allowing the reader to grasp the reasoning thread in one particular field before understanding the relations between different philosophers and their cultural/religious background.

Among the central topics in the book, my favorite chapter is Reasoning, in which Blackburn introduces the reader to symbolic logic and truth-tables. He shows how Frege overcame the ambiguity of language by introducing mathematic symbols (existential and universal quantifiers). He introduces the reader to the philosophy of language and how there are implications hidden in words like ‘but’. He shows that there is no reason to believe the sky will continue to be blue or that any law of nature will exist in the next second. He gives the example of a test for a rare disease to explain the fallacy of ignoring the base rate and explaining Bayes’ theorem. Although seemingly irrelevant, I found that these great thinkers have played an important role in forming the field of machine learning, which is the focus of our next book.

# The Master Algorithm by Pedro Domingo

I have been doing Machine Learning professionally and of course also following the AI avalanche that has been sweeping through media and the computing industry for a handful of years. The noise is only getting louder. Against this backdrop, Domingo’s book is quite good – sober, measured and mostly realistic. He provides a very nice overview of the five tribes of ML, their main domain of inspiration, representation of the world and primary learning methods: symbolists (logic, trees, inverse deduction), connectionists (neuroscience, neural nets, backpropagation), evolutionaries (evolution, genetic algorithms), Bayesians (statistics, belief networks, probabilistic inference), analogizers (psychology, templates, kernels). You can find out more about how I applied the idea of the five different tribes to a medical diagnosis and treatment.

Of course, one does not instantly become a machine learning (ML) developer after reading this book, because its content is mostly philosophical, rather than tutorial. Nonetheless, the reader will get a taste of machine learning – its impact and vision. However, one problem I encountered while reading this book was that Domingo could not adequately explain the complexities he is dealing with, partially because the field is still immature and unstructured. If you feel that you cannot understand some technical illustrations in the book, do not worry because even some ML experts themselves have a hard time with some parts of this content.

# Classical Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum by George Hrabovsky

Physics is fun, but why do many students stop learning it? I think this phenomena has to do with a combination of poor teaching methods and the way physics is stereotyped in the media. Physics is an absolutely fascinating subject. It’s about understanding the very fabric of reality. What could be more interesting than that? It depresses me to see that most people believe that the subject is dry and dull. It really isn’t. On top of that, people who study physics have to do it because they love physics, and many people do love it. But there is little prospect of future employment in the field in China and Singapore.

A lot of physics at degree level can be downright dull if not taught right. You really have to be interested in why things are the way they are from an early age to circumvent that. I can’t remember having role models as such – but I just loved taking things like Lego robots, phones and bikes to bits to see what made them tick (or to see if they’d worked when I’d put them back together), and finding math equations extraordinarily beautiful. Now I am a university student majoring in Computer Science. Although a different subject, the same learning rules apply. Just as what Elon Musk has said, “Generally I think there are — what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy.” Similarly, Prof Hrabovsky starts his explanation from first principles and slowly guides students to understand more topics in physics. I have never seen some of these topics explained with so much clarity.

Prof Hrabovsky is one of the greatest teachers in physics, and I admire his efforts to go through all of physics for the benefit of beginning students. It is a great contribution to the field as a whole. One can never overemphasise the basics. This is what separates great thinkers from ordinary ones. I find that a lot of people brush through the basics and find later that they do not have a deep understanding. The concept of state/phase space is a good example of this; they’re actually not as simple and are so critical to understanding a lot of the world, and they’re worth spending some time on.

# From Third World to First by Lee Kuan Yew

I believe that most problems, such as drought, famine, education, and poverty, are political. Without a stable, efficient and well-balanced political system, it will be the people who suffer from the results of an incompetence government and poorly designed system. While technology can be powerful and beneficial, it has to be strategically used to improve people’s lives.

To me, Lee Kuan Yew, although a controversial political figure, is undeniably an excellent strategic thinker. In this book, Lee tells a crisp and polished prose of how his group of pioneers identified the key problems of nation-building, analysed what is needed to be done, and then — with uncompromising determination — did it. While asserting his respect for authoritarian efficiency, Lee also seems to have mellowed in his championing of “Asian values” and criticism of the West’s attachment to the rights of the individual.

In the second half of the book, Lee recounts his experiences as a confidant and counsellor for world leaders. The informality of his conversations over lunch and dinner made him a valued interlocutor who knew how to “get it right” in world politics. Throughout this work, Lee’s analysis of political problems displays the workings of a brilliant lawyer’s mind unencumbered by lawyer’s jargon. He also demonstrates a genius for reading human character. His forthright evaluations of the personalities of both his Singaporean colleagues and a host of foreign leaders provide a degree of candor rare in the memoirs of political leaders.
