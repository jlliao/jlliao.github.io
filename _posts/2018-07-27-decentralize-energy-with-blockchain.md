The advent of peer-to-peer marketplace has had a tremendous impact on traditional businesses and their models, including Uber’s impact on transportation and Airbnb’s change to house renting. Despite controversies and disruption, creation of these marketplaces have led to more effective usage of resources while creating more financial benefits for individual participants. Indeed, P2P transactions are viable in cases of transportation and housing, but they seem to hardly exist in the field of energy utility, where traditionally, millions of people’s electricity needs are met by a handful of large coal, nuclear and gas-fired power stations. However, structural changes are slowly taking place in energy generation and distribution due to the entrance of green energy and blockchain technology development. In the end of the article, I have provided a Proof of Concept demo based on SAP Cloud Platform Hyperledger Fabric and IoT devices.

# The Current Bizarre System for Renewable Energy Trading

Thanks to years of efforts to raise awareness on environmental issues, more and more consumers are now concerned with the negative impacts of fossil-based power sources. They seek ways to purchase “green” renewable energy generated from solar and wind sources. Especially in Europe, governments under the Paris Climate Agreement have started to incentivize their citizens and companies to use green energy. Since more rigorous laws and regulations have been introduced, companies begin to adopt green energy not only to strategically improve their public images, but to also comply with national policies that can lower their financial risks. People are increasingly installing solar panels on their rooftops and more investments are going into renewable energy technology. These are all good news to countries striving to lower carbon emissions.

However, on an electricity grid, electrons generated from the sun, wind, or other renewable sources are indistinguishable from those generated by fossil fuels. To keep track of how much clean energy is produced, or to authenticate whether the energy is clean, governments around the world have created systems based on tradable certificates. But the problem is, these systems are extremely complex and inefficient, often holding up investments in renewable power. Consumers of renewable energy, including many large corporations, are hindered by the inability to authenticate green energy in a timely manner.

Today, there are still three parties involved in the transaction between consumers and renewable energy providers. When a renewable power plant generates a unit of electricity, its meter data is shared with a registry provider who then transfers the data into another system in order to manually create a certificate. Then enters a second group of intermediary brokers who connect buyers and sellers in exchange for service fees. Before the transaction between buyer and seller happens, another third party needs to verify these purchased certificates before customers can finally use them.

It is unimaginable that such system still exists in the time when items can be traded directly on Amazon without any intermediaries. Although this transaction/authentication system is extremely complex, it cannot prevent accounting errors and double certification frauds. Moreover, with individual actors charging fees for services, this byzantine system racks up transaction costs, making the renewable energy market difficult to access and highly inefficient.

# Color Our Electrons - Give Energy Transparency

To ensure that accurate records of meters and transactions are kept, blockchain technology can be used to deliver transparency and trust to the marketplace. Instead of having three different actors managing renewable energy transactions, a single transactional platform based on blockchain technology can dramatically simplify the current system. Rather than storing data individually, all meter and transaction data can be directly stored in a blockchain where everyone on the network can view.

In addition, due to immutability of blockchain, the energy transaction system would be fault-tolerant and almost un-hackable (any abnormality of meter records will be detected as everyone has their own, regularly updated copy of the ledger). Moreover, intermediaries disappear as accreditation and validation functions are integrated into blockchain transaction protocols.

Such a streamlined system will solve almost all problems of the current system, but there is much more potential. Traditionally, customers can hardly change their energy provider due to insufficient data on consumer usage or wrong recordings of meter addresses. However, distributed ledger can allow holding and transferring the permission to access energy data to be cheaper and easier. Thus, switching between different energy providers may now become a convenient click on the internet.

If we take one step even further, envision a world in which homes and buildings are equipped with software that automatically sell and buy power to and from the grid on the basis of real-time price signals. The cheapest energy can be consumed from various providers based on different periods of time, and customers can configure which type or combination of types of energy source they would like to purchase. Meanwhile, blockchain also would allow grid operators to have a more informed overview of the resource they manage. Although turning down the supply will cost money, stations with resources that are constrained will gladly do it for a cheaper price.

# The Rise of Microgrid and a Proof of Concept Demo

Lowered costs and eased access will enhance energy market participation, but with our current conventional national grid, energy transfers can only take place between large and centralized power stations and consumers. P2P transactions cannot happen unless something else is implemented – microgrids. These smaller grid systems are linked to localized power sources, including buildings in a city with their own solar panels and nearby residences. Surplus electricity can be sold to neighbors and all the information would be safely secured on the blockchain.

For this P2P energy trading marketplace scenario, I have developed a Proof of Concept demo by utilizing the SAP Blockchain technology during my internship at SAP. In the demo, certain prosumers (producer + consumer) are producing energy through solar panels or other means, and they can sell excess energy to other consumers, such as someone who owns an electric car. Each unit (kWh) of energy generated will be transferred to an energy token. Prosumers and consumers can then trade the energy tokens with their coins, which are exchangeable with other currencies. The transaction can either be manually triggered on an web application, or triggered by an action from IoT device.

To manage the grids of the future with more intelligence, systems will have to become efficient and adaptive. Our conventional system has many inherent problems: the nature of shared energy resources of different types and the difficulty of tracking large volumes of transactions – from energy supply and demand to actual sales. Blockchain may not be the panacea, but it gave us a credible alternative.
