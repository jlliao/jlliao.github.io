Who does not like to be rewarded for putting in efforts and finances? Gamification is an exciting trend and an innovative solution that is becoming increasingly popular amongst the conversations on retention marketing. Gamification takes something that already exists – a website, an enterprise application, an online community – and integrates game mechanics into it to motivate participation, engagement, and loyalty. Instead of external stimuli, such as television, newspaper or social media, that persistently intrude a consumer’s attention, gamification is an internal stimulus that builds on a consumer’s achievement. Under the guidance of a gamification program, the consumer is directed towards a vision that incorporates the value of a brand or product. In today’s blog, I will explain this concept by showing how gamification can improve the loyalty of small accounts in general businesses.

# Why Gamification Is the Perfect Fit for General Business Market 

A few weeks ago, I had worked with my team to increase the engagement of small accounts. My team deals with top accounts, but to help boost our firm, we were tasked to help the General Business (GB) department with their small accounts. Our main issue was that small accounts tended to have only one-off engagements. This meant that we did not get to track our entire sales service journey with these small accounts. My team and I decided to implement gamification to improve our small accounts’ loyalty. 

To start, nothing beats talking directly to the stakeholders of the issue. The insight you get is priceless, and no amount of quantitative data will let you reach the same level of understanding. My team conducted interviews with managers and members of the GB department to ask them about sales operation, particularly about barriers in securing a deal. We then mapped out the sales journey of our small accounts, including touch points with our GB salesmen and our responses to our customers’ demands.

GB market managers tend to take charge hundreds of small account, so sales of products rely heavily on our partners. Yet our partners dedicate limited time and effort to each of our customers, so the response rate and quality of service are usually not up to standard. Dissatisfaction may be widespread amongst our GB customers, but what troubles me is our company’s lack of awareness for this issue since our customer’s satisfaction and our service quality is difficult to assess. No customer survey has been conducted, and moreover, there is little customer participation and engagement along the sales journey apart from a few touch points. Here, gamification could come in to play an important part in transforming the customer experience.

The core of our gamification model is based on scarcity in terms of time and attention given by our professional partners. In a game, and likewise in real life, people strive for rare goods or services, which can be obtained when they reach some form of achievement. The greater the achievement, the more one can obtain. This intrinsic motivation makes the upper status of tiered programs highly desirable for any type of consumer. Hence, our gamification model introduces a loyalty program where the progress of each tier will allow the customer unlock access to more time and attention from our professional partners.

# How Gamification Mechanics Can Be Incorproated into Sales and Services

Since I have explained the nature and purpose of our gamification model, I will now explain how this program is implemented to activate its functionalities. 

Firstly, we must let our customers know the rules of the game for them to succeed. We have established a manual for our customers to understand, operate and navigate our loyalty program. Benefits of the program are clearly highlighted to ensure that our customers are continuously engaged throughout their progression. They should be able to understand how our tiers work at a glance, so we need to make the manual highly visual.

A loyalty program is only truly effective if customers are motivated to consistently spend more to reach higher and higher tiers. This is why increasing repeat sales is usually cited as a program’s number one goal.  The trick, of course, is getting customers commit to making ongoing purchases with our products and services. This is where the consistency principle of gamification comes in. Since higher status loyalty members tend to maintain their positions, they will be more willing to make purchases on our cloud platform than first-time visitors. However, we should not take this desire for granted. Goals are always more motivating if customers can visually track their progress. This method is often used in health and fitness applications where consumers visually track results like weight loss, run speed, or miles walked. In our loyalty program, customers are much more likely to be deeply invested if they can see both where they are and how much further they need to go.

The last – but certainly not least – way that we can incorporate gamification into our loyalty program is with social rewards. Customers love to share their achievements online, and if our top-tier consumers feel exclusive, they will most definitely want to showcase their achievements through outlets such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. These actions contribute to the brand identity we are building online and provide valuable social proof that can mean the difference between new customers checking out our platform or passing by.

Furthermore, involving customers in brand conversations on social media will encourage more loyal customers to become brand advocates. Making it easy for our members to contribute to the social conversation around the brand will move customers closer to achieving their brand ambassador goals. With an expanded marketing reach, the brand’s awareness will increase exponentially and our program will continue to grow.

# Grow Your Loyalty with Gamification

Gamification is an incredibly powerful tool if you understand its mechanics. By leveraging your program’s goals and the psychological factors behind them, gamification can be used to improve repeat purchase rate, customer experience and develop impactful brand advocates that take the program to the next level. 

Customer loyalty is not a game, but we can help our customer win.
