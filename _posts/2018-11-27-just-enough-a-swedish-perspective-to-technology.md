When I pick up an electronic product, clad with technological functions in its description, I often question why I would need it. Indeed, an exclusive focus on technological goals can fail to recognize all the stakeholders related to a technology and address real user needs. However, strolling around the Nordic Museum in Stockholm, where thousands of exhibits showcase the transforming lifestyle of Swedish people, I was amazed by the minimalistic yet extremely functional design of Scandinavian furnitures and appliances. Why is Sweden so good at making tech everyone actually wants? How do Swedes master the art of living simply while still chasing progress with passion?

### Useful and Simple: Swedish Functional Design

Swedish design is the perfect marriage of minimalism and functionalism. It embodies the idea that a product should serve its purpose with minimal materials and light components; only what is needed is used. This ideology sounds easy to follow, but hard to execute in reality. It requires the innovator/designer to consider more critically than common designers, because for a well-designed functional blueprint, the designer, instead of tweaking the previous design to add improvements, needs to decompose the whole design, assess every element in meticulous detail and think of new ways to improve functionalities and diminish drawbacks.

Functionalism is ingrained in every aspect of Swedish products. Not far from Stockholm’s city centre is Army Museum, a great place to learn about the evolution of warfare and innovative weaponry. As I walked into the museum, a formidable S-tank greeted me at the front gate. It is a representative weapon of the innovative Swedish military industry and an interesting example of  Swedish design.

The S-tank is one of a kind, concentrating so many innovative solutions and new ideas into one vehicle. To this day, it has left an unmistakable imprint in tank design. Unlike any other tank, which has a moveable gun turret built on top of its chassis, the S tank does not have a turret, the most vulnerable part of a tank, and its gun is directly fixed inside the chassis, which allows the driver to both drive and aim the gun at the same time. The gun can be aimed by moving the entire tank, horizontally by pivoting the tank using its tracks, vertically by raising and lowering the tank via its hydropneumatic suspension system. With a fixed gun, the S-tank’s hull could be made as low as possible, leaving less exposed area for enemy fires.

The design was radical, yet suited the Swedish landscape filled with forests and tundra and perfectly fitted for the Swedish defensive doctrine. It does not look like any other tanks, and without a turret, the tank weighs a mere 40 tons, much lighter than other tanks that normally weigh 70 tons. However, S-tank is tough enough to survive a 5 kiloton tactical nuclear explosion. This is a typical product of the Swedish design which uses less to achieve more.

Not limited to military engineering, minimalism can also be found in the Swedish robotics design.

Earlier this month, Furhat Robotics launched its face-swapping social robot after many years of development and prototyping. The project began at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Rather than being an actual robot, Furhat is something that robots are built on top of. Without any complicated mechanical components that dramatically increase the difficulty of engineering and chances of failure, Furhat’s face consists of two parts: an opaque mask and a projection system that beams faces onto it. This design seems too simplistic for a robot, yet serves its purpose of imitating human expressions and being sociable. Moreover, since Furhat does not have any physical moving part, it can change faces simply by altering the projection.  I was marveled by this functional design. It occurred to me that the motto “less is more” is very well-applied to Swedish tech industry.

### The Birth and Progress of Swedish Functionalism

Swedish innovators and designers were influenced by everything going on around them. With their tradition of craftsmanship and efficient use of limited material resources (due to their relative geographic isolation), they combined the best of both worlds. In line with prevailing democratic social views, everything was made to be available to everyone. The notion of enjoying the work you do was highly regarded, and the idea that beautiful things could enrich people’s lives was kept alive.

The Swedish Society of Industrial Design was established in 1845 to uphold and raise the high standards in various crafts-related professions. The fact that industrialization took place in Scandinavia later than in neighboring countries helped to preserve the handicraft tradition there.

Early in the 20th century, with more and more people moving from the countryside to cities.  Society broadened its scope and committed to raising standards of design in everyday life. The quest to make objects of high aesthetic quality available to the masses began in earnest during the 1920s and ’30s. Beauty, humanism and democratic ideals were the order of the day.

Mass machine production did not dominate Sweden as much in the years between the two World Wars as it did in the US. The scale of the industry was much smaller, and after World War II Sweden established institutions and schools to preserve the craft traditions. Processes derived from the crafts were integrated into commercial production, creating what became known as the industrial arts.

The thread running through Swedish design is functionalism. For hundreds of years, the need for products to just work was ingrained in the Swedish soul. It hadn’t been very long since this was a requirement for survival. The focus was on “need,” or function, not on decoration or beauty.

Moving into the machine age, surviving became easier, and functionalism evolved into also meeting the emotional needs of people. This gave Nordic functionalism a more natural and humanistic side. But there still existed more extreme approaches to functionalism, which stripped all decoration in favor of pure function.

The long winters and few hours of sunlight inspired Swedish designers to create practical environments. They tried to make the domestic environment as comfortable as possible with the materials at hand. These trends were picked up by neighboring countries and eventually spread all over the world. The high-quality designs live on today and are recreated continually in various fields, confirming their timelessness.

### We Need Functionalism More Than Ever

Today, there are many products that are considerably over-designed, often premised on promises to reinvent things that we used to take for granted.

The $400 Wi-Fi-connected juicer, Juicero, built by Doug Evans as “the first at home cold-pressed juicing system,” promised so much when it launched in 2016. It promised convenience. Wellness. A world where a glass of fresh juice in the morning didn’t require the effort to squeeze pulpy citrus with bare hands. Juicero claims simplicity by allowing the user to pull out a produce pack, then securing it between the Juicero’s flat squeezing plates and pressing a button to get instant cold-pressed juice. What a breeze.

In April 2017, Bloomberg showed that Juicero’s produce packs were essentially giant ketchup sachets of fruit and vegetable pulp that could be easily squeezed with bare hands. No need to scan the QR code on the bag. No need to sync the app. No need to insert the produce pack into Juicero.

Juicero represented something that we need to think twice about “disruption” in one single product. We are constantly told by startups and disruptors that legacy industries need to be shaken up. That the tech world needs to move fast and break things. But do we really need to reinvent something that was actually pretty alright in the first place?

In the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design, I found a book called Acceptera,  a Swedish modern architecture manifesto. In the book, the authors argue that the production of housing and consumer goods must embrace a functionalist orientation in order to meet the particular cultural and material needs of both modern society and the modern individual. A quote from the manifesto may guide us towards a direction where technological innovation should proceed:

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible: buildings, furniture, drinking glasses may well be consumer items that we can destroy without regret after they have served for some short or long period, but while we use them we expect them to fulfill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic enjoyment from observing them in use.
