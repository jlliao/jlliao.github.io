Here is customers’ rigid demand: being accepted by the society. Technology is cold and aggressive because its unstoppable advancement could leave many people behind. However, if you manage to integrate something into our daily lives and allow more people to be embraced by technology, would that not be the best and ultimate vision of any new invention?

# The Art of Subtraction

Recently, Intel has taken a bold step that many would not dare to take: leave out most functionalities and return to minimalistic design to allow convenient access to necessary information. Vaunt, Intel’s new smart glasses, has no techie screen to look at, no gesture or speech recognition, and most importantly, no camera. There is only a red square screen projected directly into the retina by a low-powered laser below the visual line. At first, such move may seem counter-intuitive, because for the past four decades consumers have always been expecting Intel to deliver more computational power and higher performance in limited space and time. Meanwhile, Intel is leaving more space for imagination and creativity by miniaturizing parts that need not be seen by the most users.

But clearly, Intel’s ambition does not stop there. Despite chip development having steadily increased over the past few decades, Moore’s Law seems to imply that such development is closely approaching its end and that continual miniaturization has its bottleneck. It appears that Intel seeks to expand its excellency in hardware engineering by transitioning to product design. This move appears to be one that expresses intel’s intent to not merely be a participant in the data processing phase, but also become a key player in data representation. As Apple has demonstrated the success in the integration of hardware and product, Vaunt, I believe, is Intel’s entry point to the consumer goods market.

By putting fewer features into Vaunt, Intel is determined to put user experiences at heart of its product design philosophy.

# The Success of "Less"

Every time we look at the upgrades of a product, we always ask one question, “What’s new?”. Whether it’s the facial recognition or screen-integrated fingerprint scanner, cutting-edge features are embedded to woo customers and add more applications to the agent. In the craze of competing to compact all functionalities into devices amongst competitors, cutting and taking away functions takes more courage than adding in functionalities and its importance is sometimes underestimated.

Most people would agree that the first iPhone is a revolutionary product, which makes computation more personalized and intimate. Nevertheless, what truly makes iPhone legendary is not those innovative features – multi-touch screen, bran-new interactions, but the physical keyboard that Apple decided to remove. Such cutting provides so much more flexibility for the developers, allowing more customization and usability.

Therefore, for a product designer or business developer, mastering how to cut is equally or more important as mastering how to add. Customers should feel empowered, not intimidated by what you could provide.

# What Is the Future of Wearables?

Six months ago, Intel forwent its cooperation with Fitbit and had directed its focus to augmented reality. On average, 80% of the buyers would no longer use the wearable gadgets in six months. Meanwhile, Google Glass is still far from becoming a necessity and its use case is still unclear. How to make wearables more humane?

Intel gave its answer: make it less intrusive and minimize the learning cost. You do not have to change your lifestyle to use Vaunt; instead, Vaunt makes your life better. It only shows information when you look at it.

Compared to smartphones, smart glasses shorten the distance between your senses and gadget to an unprecedented extent. Some people may argue that smartphone also inevitably guide and fixate your vision.

But this time is different. For the first time, smart glasses can directly “control” your senses. Such loss of control will keep anyone away because insecurity is the worst nightmare that anyone can have. No matter how good the product is, fear will always kill attraction. Thus, by making Vaunt appear as normal as possible, Intel has achieved something more important – giving warmth to technology.  To give wearable technology another chance, locking up the coldness of technology seems like it should be the first step to development.
